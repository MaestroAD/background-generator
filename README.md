# Background Generator

For those developers who don't want to type in all the rgba code as well as look for the correct rgb numbers for the perfect color.

Well, this is a solution for UX/UI designers + developers who can simply get the background they want with just a click of a button, and the code is generated for you as well as a live preview of the background!

# Live Demo Deployed
No need to clone this repo, unless ofcourse you would love to add more DOM element features that improve the design and front-end process with a few simple clicks! Please let me know what ideas you have, and we can work together to develop small solutions that help make the front-end development lifecycle easier and allow them to deploy larger projects in no time!
