# Background Generator

For those developers who don't want to type in all the rgba code as well as look for the correct rgb numbers for the perfect color.

Well, this is a solution for UX/UI designers + developers who can simply get the background they want with just a click of a button, and the code is generated for you as well as a live preview of the background!

***Note:*** Will deploy live demo, so you won't have to go thru the additional step of cloning this repo. ***Stay tuned!***
